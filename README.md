# tic-tac-toe

I am creating a tic-tac-toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Let's be clear, this project is not the best. The code is
disorganized, the logic behind the project is okay, the names 
are okay, there are some bugs, and probably many other things. 

But, I learned a lot from these mistakes. First of all, 
I rushed into coding wihtout fully understanding what I wanted
to code. This made the code very inefficient. In addition,
I always coded my first solution I had to any problem that occured.
This also made the code very inefficient. With a little extra time
of thinking through my plan or problems, I would have been able to
make my code much better.

I cannot wait to learn more.
